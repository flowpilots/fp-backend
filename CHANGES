Hook in autoquit. This will shut down daemons in production after a certain
amount of time. This is on by default so disable it in your project if this is
not intended behavior.

v0.3.0 (16/12/2011)
===================

Switch to the Google Closure Compiler for JS-minification as uglify-js breaks
things. Doing a major version bump because this may in turn break things even
though I highly doubt it.

v0.2.2 (01/04/2012)
===================

Hook in autoquit. This will shut down daemons in production after a certain
amount of time. This is on by default so disable it in your project if this is
not intended behavior.

===================

Renamed Session to ActiveSession to avoid clashes with user-space code in the
mongo database.

===================

Changes to the client-compiler, which now requires you to include
'name.bundle.js' in development and 'name.bundle.min.js' in production.

Project changes required:
* Load the .bundle.js. Put this in your view:
  script(src='/js/app.bundle.' + (process.env.NODE_ENV == 'production' ? 'min.js' : 'js'))
