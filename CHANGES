v0.3.0 (16/12/2011)
===================

Switch to the Google Closure Compiler for JS-minification as uglify-js breaks
things. Doing a major version bump because this may in turn break things even
though I highly doubt it.

v0.2.1 (23/11/2011)
===================

Renamed Session to ActiveSession to avoid clashes with user-space code in the
mongo database.

v0.2.0 (21/11/2011)
===================

Changes to the client-compiler, which now requires you to include
'name.bundle.js' in development and 'name.bundle.min.js' in production.
